    CI/CD and Jenkins
server - computer that is used to serve other computers.
Environment - place where server is running application. All
environments, except production, have a dummy data (fake data).
dev --> test --> stage --> production
dev - used by developers only
test - used for functional testing, used by us and for non-functional
testing like performance.
stage - UAT (User Acceptance Testing)
production - the real application, used by end-users.
NOTE: There could be other environments, not
every single company has only these 4. For
example: UAT, Integration, pre-prod, TESTA, TESTB,
TESTC, etc.
when new build is deployed to any environment, smoke test should
be automatically executed.
daily, smoke test is running on the test environment. If something
happened with a test environment, we won’t be able to work. When
test environment is down, everybody should be aware of it asap.
That's why we run smoke test after new build (because new changes
could broke something), and periodically (every morning), because
something could happened overnight that caused server problems.
After release, we do smoke test in the production environment, fore
sure.
CI - Continues Integration
It's software development practice, where developers use
VCS(version control system, like GIT) and integrate frequently their
changes.
Also, those changes will be automatically tested. (code quality scans,
unit and integration tests)
Continues Integration encourage developers to commit changes for
often, so they can be tested and integrated into main branch. Also,
developers will receive a feedback more often.
I would say it's easier to digest small pieces little by little rather than
digesting huge bulk at once.
CD - Continuous Delivery
Continuous Delivery is an automated build and execution of at unit
and integration tests, performing code analysis, functional tests and
also deploying to any supported platform any time. Each time a build
or a set of code passes the tests, it’s automatically deployed out to a
staging environment.
In Continuous Delivery releasing to end users is a manual process.
Continuous delivery involves human decision-making when it comes
to deciding when to release the software to the customers.

CD - Continuous Deployment
Continuous deployment means that every change that you make,
goes through the pipeline, and if it passes all the tests, it
automatically gets deployed into production.
When a developer commits code, the automated processes takes the
code and move it through the entire life-cycle and if it passes each
gate, it gets deployed directly to production. The delivery speeds are
notably faster due to elimination of manual steps.
Continues Integration - build + unit test + integration tests + code
analysis
Continues Delivery - Continues Integration + smoke testing +
regression testing + performance testing + deployment to Staging
environment. Everything is automated except release.
Continues Deployment - Continues Delivery + automatic release.
The goal of CI/CD is a shorter release cycle. So
end-users can get new version of application,
with new features of with fixed bugs, faster.
Faster software release --> better software -->
higher client satisfaction
 Q: Is it possible to release new software without testing? -
 A: No, that's why testing/QA plays essential role in this entire
process. Before releasing a new version of software, regression
testing MUST be done.
Regression testing can be done either manually or automatically.
Manually - takes time, less accurate.
If regression testing is done manually, forget about short release
cycles.
In my company, before automation, regression testing was done
manually, and it was about 2 weeks. Before I left, our regression was
running around 2.5 hours. It's because of parallelization and running
35 browsers at once. We used 5 servers to distribute tests and
execute them faster. We were running regression in stage
environment.

every company have to have at least 4 environments:

dev --> qa --> stage --> production

#dev - reserved for developers, once changes were committed, devs
can build a new version of software and deploy it to dev
environment.

#qa - reserved for us, this is were we do testing

#stage - preparation for release, this is were performance testing and
UAT testing can be done before release

#production - environment of end-user, real data
###########################
# dev - dev.vytrack.com
#
# qa - qa.vytrack.com
#
# stage - stage.vytrack.com
#
# production - vytrack.com
###########################
deployment - process of creating a new build and delivering it to the
application server.

application server - program that makes web application running and
accessible over the browser.

All environments have same application, but with different version.
Newest version in dev, oldest in production.

Every environment has its own database, and all of them, except
PRODUCTION, have dummy/fake data.

dev - reserved for developers.
Most of the companies just stick with Continues Delivery, and prefer
to trigger release manually.

Jenkins
Jenkins is an open-source automation tool written in Java with
plugins built for Continuous Integration purposes. Jenkins is used to
build and test your software projects continuously making it easier
for developers to integrate changes to the project, and making it
easier for users to obtain a fresh build. It also allows you to
continuously deliver your software by integrating with a large
number of testing and deployment technologies.
With Jenkins, organizations can accelerate the software development
process through automation. Jenkins integrates development lifecycle processes of all kinds, including build, document, test, package,
stage, deploy, static analysis, and much more.
Jenkins achieves Continuous Integration with the help of plugins.
Plugins allows the integration of Various DevOps stages. If you want
to integrate a particular tool, you need to install the plugins for that
tool. For example: Git, Maven 2 project, Amazon EC2, HTML
publisher etc.
Jenkins credentials: username and password is
admin.
enter into search box ip:8081 or ip:8080 to hit Jenkins.

default port for Jenkins is 8080. In our case, it was switched to 8081.
web application - any application used over the browser.
Steps to create a smoke test job:
1. Go to dashboard --> new item --> Smoke test | freestyle project
2. Select git as a VCS and insert project URL: https://github.com/
CybertekSchool/TestAutomationProject.git
3. Build -->> Invoke Top-level maven targets --> clean test -P
Smoke
or, if you don't have a profile, use: clean test -Dcucumber.options="--
tags @smoke_test"
4. Proceed to Post Build actions --> Select cucumber report
5. Click build now!!!

##########################################################################


    git is VCS (Version Control System)

    the main idea of git is to track changes

    snapshot of changes is called commit

    every commit must have a commit message

    commit message must explain what was changed in the code


    git vs github

 - git it's a VCS, local repository
            - github - facebook for developers, hosting for git projects, remote repository

    github alternatives: Bitbucket, Gitlab, etc..

    how do we work with git repository?

    Q: When I will go to work, am I gonna create github repo?

            - no. If project already exists, you would just need to clone it.
            If it's a brand new project, there is gonna be some admin,
            who creates accounts, repositories, etc..

    Q: How to clone and what to clone?

            - you are making clone to get a copy of the repo. Everyone works on their own
            copy of repo.

    in terminal: git clone <GIT_REPO_URL>

    in intellij: new --> project from version control --> select git and provide repo URL


    Q: How to create a repository?

    local repository - repository on your computer

    remote repository - repository on the server (github)

    to create local repository:

    git init

this command should be executed only once, to initialize git repository on ur local computer.
 Make sure that you run this command in the project folder.

            Q: How do I know that I am in the project folder?

    execute pwd in the terminal: pwd (print work directory)

    Also, use command ls to see list of file in the current directory.

    If you want to see all files, including hidden files:

    ls -a     | list all files

.git folder - this is a local repo folder.

    com.sun.java.swing.plaf.windows.resources.windows users, use gitbash.

    Here is the equivalent of unix commands in com.sun.java.swing.plaf.windows.resources.windows:

    Windows: cd
    Mac pwd

    Windows: dir
    Mac: ls -a

    Please create a new project.

    Name of the project/artifact ID: spring-2020-git-practice

    everything else is default

    First thing that you have to do is to create a .gitignore file

    Every company has a template for .gitignore

    to create it, right click on project name --> new --> file --> .gitignore

    NOTE: close the file once you are done with listing.

            Put this into the file:

            .idea
            target
            *.iml
            *.log


    first 3 are must, we haven't met log files yet, I will show you tomorrow what is that.

    git init - to create new local repo

    git status - to see what's new in this repo


    THE FLOW:

    Step 1.


    new files ---> git add (to stage files, will prepare files for commit)

    To remove files/folders from the staging area:

    git rm --cached <file_name/folder_path>

    red: untracked by git
    green: tracked by git
    black:  ignored by git (listed in .gitignore file) or committed.

    If git status, gives you error, you don't have git repo, local repo.

    Step 2. Commit changes

    git commit -m "this is a commit message"

      - commit message, contains short descriptions of changes and/or associated jira issue number.


    git commit -m "@VIT-1231 User should be able to edit event's end time"

    use git log ==>  to see the history of commits.

    commit de7e470942bb52a5d3faa7ff9dfaa47cad43cbcb (HEAD -> master)
    Author: Vasyl Fomiuk <vasyl@cybertekschool.com>
    Date:   Mon Jul 20 11:40:50 2020 -0400

    first commit

    every commit has a commit hash. It's a commit id.

    Step 2.5 Create README.md file to provide instructions for your project.

    NOTE: by default, you might not have markdown plugin, so please install it whenever intellij is offering.

   Step 3. We need to create remote repo for this project.

            commit#1	-------> 	commit#2

           pom.xml file            README.md
            .giitnore

          first commit           second commit


    fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git ?

    Run git init

    STEPS:

    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "message"

//some changes in the project

    git add .
    git commit -m "message"

//some changes in the project

    git add .
    git commit -m "message"

//some changes in the project

    git add .
    git commit -m "message"

    git log

    added readme.md file

    commit de7e470942bb52a5d3faa7ff9dfaa47cad43cbcb
    Author: Vasyl Fomiuk <vasyl@cybertekschool.com>
    Date:   Mon Jul 20 11:40:50 2020 -0400

    first commit

    Every commit will be reflected in the log.

    If it opened editor, enter

:q! and hit enter

    IF YOU NEED TO DELETE.

    For mac: rm -rf .git ==> it deletes git repository
    For windows: del .git / deltree .git

    git status - to check if repo is created

    You can also delete this folder via file explorer, but make sure to make hidden files visible:

            for mac: command + shift + .

            for windows:

    Open File Explorer from the taskbar.
    Select View > Options > Change folder and search options.
    Select the View tab and, in Advanced settings, select Show hidden files, folders, and drives and OK.

            https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028316/windows-view-hidden-files-and-folders-in-windows-10

1. Folder that you see in intellij
2. This is an area where files are getting prepared for commit
3. once you commit, updates are going to local repo
4. once you push, updates are going to github


	1. 					  2. 			       	3. 				4.
work directory --->   staging area --> local repo ---> remote repo


if you are getting 403 error, it means that you can see repo but you are not allowed to commit there.

    Why it happens? because username that is used on your computer is different from remote repo account.

    To setup github credentials:

    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email "youremail@yourdomain.com"
    git config --global user.password "github password"

    Q: How often do we commit?

    - usually, at the end of work day. It's very bad practice to commit once a week or once in 2 weeks.

    To get updates

    git pull

    To add everything and commit:

    git commit -a -m "commit message"  is the same as git add . & git commit

    git fetch - pull updates from remote to local repo
    git merge - to merge local repo and work directory

    git pull (fetch + merge)

  Whenever you have a conflict, follow these steps:

Step 1. git pull

Step 2.  Go over conflicting files.
 If you are not sure what should stay in the final version of conflicting files,
 you can text/call to the person that can help you to decide what should stay.

Step 3. Commit changes

 		git commit -a -m "some message"

Step 4. Push changes to remote repo

 		git push

Remember: make sure to pull before push!

:q and hit enter/return to exit from text editor.

To stash changes/to keep changes we made somewhere safe before pushing:

	git stash

To see list of stashes:

	git stash list

To apply first stash

    git stash pop

Then, you need to resolve conflicts. After you resolved all conflicts, you can commit and push your code.

Why do we need to stash?

	Let's say wee need to do the pull, and we have some unfinished work.
	In this case, we cannot commit our changes, resolve conflicts and push.
	 To remove changes temporary and pull updates we can stash them.

Step 1. You are trying to pull but it fails
Step 2. run: git stash
Step 3. run: git pull
Step 4. run: git stash pop
Step 5. Resolve conflicts
Step 6. Stage all changes (git add .)
Step 7. Commit (git commit -m "some message")
Step 8. Push commits to github (git push)

#DONE#

git stash clear - to delete all stashes

To remove changes in specific file, use git checkout <file_name>

	 git checkout cars.txt

usually, master branch is locked from direct commits. Instead, everyone is working on their
own branch.

you are working within your own branch, commit and push to the remote, buy still your branch.

How to create a branch?

 git branch <branch_name>

How to switch to new branch?

 git checkout <branch_name>

How to push new branch to github?

git push --set-upstream origin <branch_name>

and then just git push

before push, always:

 git add .
 git commit -m "commit message"
 git push (first time, for every new branch: git push --set-upstream origin <branch_name>)

     */
}
